A place where some useful R code from others is gathered


## * `find_colors.R`

This R code is borrowed to Earl F. Glynn. You can find it on [this](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/) webpage. I made a slight modification to the code in order to display the color names instead of color numbers in the colored rectangles.
