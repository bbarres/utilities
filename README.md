This is a place where some miscellaneous and/or some useful R codes borrowed from others are gathered


## `find_colors.R`

This R code was borrowed to [Earl F. Glynn](http://www.efg2.com/). You can find this and more [ here](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/). I made a slight modification to the code in order to display the color names instead of color numbers in the colored rectangles.
