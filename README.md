A place where some useful R code from others is gathered


## `find_colors.R`

This R code was borrowed to Earl F. Glynn. You can find this and more [ here](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/) . I made a slight modification to the code in order to display the color names instead of color numbers in the colored rectangles.
